CouchDB is a web oriented database written that you interact with via HTTP and JavaScript. Couch's best kept secret is its peer to peer [[replication]] protocol which lets any instance of Couch synchronize with any other instance.

The easiest way to start playing around with Couch is to either download a [binary distribution](http://couchbase.com/downloads) or [get a hosted couch for free](http://www.iriscouch.com/).

Couch also is capable of hosting simple HTML5 web applications called [CouchApps](http://couchapp.org/page/index).
