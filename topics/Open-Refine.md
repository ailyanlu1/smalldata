Open Refine (formerly called Google Refine, fka Freebase GridWorks) is a desktop application for cleaning up messy datasets through a visual interface.

There are some awesome getting started videos on the [Refine Google Code page](http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/), and a tutorial video that demonstrates how to clean up open data with Refine [over on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/18351837)
