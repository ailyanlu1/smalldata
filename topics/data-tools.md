One open data power trifecta consists of [[Google Refine]], [[ScraperWiki]] and [[CouchDB]]

An example workflow might be:

* Scrape data from a webpage using ScraperWiki
* Download the CSV from ScraperWiki into Google Refine and clean it up
* Push the cleaned data into CouchDB so that it is replicable to anyone

There are workflows still in development that would automate these steps.
