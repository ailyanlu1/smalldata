in terms of social networks (from [[http://ostatus.org]]) :

>  OStatus' goal is to help you to follow people on different social networks. It is a specification and usage of several web standards to allow this functionality, technically. This is most useful for sending status updates to friends around the world in your networks (but often different companies' networks).

some important parts of decentralization theory for the internets include [[replication]] and distributed hash tables
