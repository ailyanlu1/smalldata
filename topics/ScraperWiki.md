Write web scrapers in your browser in Ruby, PHP or Python (and soon node.js)! Each scraper gets run daily to go fetch new content, and the structured data output is available through a nice API. If scrapers break anyone can go in and fix them (it's a wiki!).

Accounts on [http://scraperwiki.com/](http://scraperwiki.com/) are free and the software itself is open source and writen in Python (Django and Twisted).
